# Group 7: Codility Test Group Pracitice.

## Question one

Write a function:
function solution(A) that,
given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum among all integers which are multiples of 4.For example, given array A as follows:

```
Input: num = [-6, -91, 1011, -100, 84, -22, 0, 1, 473]

Output: 84.

```

## Question Two

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

```

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]

Output: 4

```

## Question Three

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

```

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

```
